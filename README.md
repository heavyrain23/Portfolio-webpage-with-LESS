# Portfolio-webpage-with-LESS

This simple landing page was built with html, css and js. For html i've used the BEM methodology. Also the htlm document contains fonts downloaded from fonts.google.com.
I've used the Jquery library downloaded from the official website to make a website animation. This website includes 2 modal windows - "hire me" and "see my resume"
Also a responsive version for devices notebook: 1199px, tablet: 991px, mobile: 767px and mobile-sm: 565px was realized In this project.
